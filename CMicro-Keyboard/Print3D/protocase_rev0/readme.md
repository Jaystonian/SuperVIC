Prototype case for an external VIC-20 or C64 keyboard in "micro" size.

These boards are 10" wide so the case is about 10.5".  I needed to test the mounting and surface cuts for the actual SuperVIC case design, so there won't be another version of this external keyboard.
I learned that the mounts for the bottom of the case need to allow more space for the keyboard PCB.

Not completed or included are the pegs and keycaps.  Keys for this are 11x13mm and follow the 1X, 1.25X, 1.5X, etc, format of key sizes.
